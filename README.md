# Starbound-Docker
Starbound Docker with Mods Support

# Step One (If using SteamGuard or Don't want to expose your account)

Because steam requires a username and password for downloading starbound we need to provide this how ever you may not want to use your main account eather because you don't like the idea of your password in plain text or that you don't want to disable SteamGuard

## Make Dedicated Server Token

1. Go to the [dedicated token management page](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/managegameservers)
2. Login with your account that owns Starbound
3. In the App ID of the base game field enter `211820`
4. In the Memo field enter a nickname for your server for example `Starbound Docker Server`
5. Click the `Create` button
6. Copy down the token and place it in your password vault such as bitwarden, lastpass, keypass, etc... I recommend the name `Starbound Dedicated Server Steam Token`
